        <h3>Top 3 Places</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Butler Cafe - Brooklyn, NY</dt>
            <dd>Dubbed a <i>neighborhood favorite</i>, this cafe serves breakfast, dinner, and lunch. My friend and I ended up here around 6:00 AM after a 5 hour bus ride. Her and I think this place is <b>incredible</b>, or perhaps we were just starving.</dd>

            <dt>Hui Lau Shan - Irvine, CA</dt>
            <dd>Hui Lau Shan is a dessert shop focused on mango items! Everything is mango-related and its curated menu is very unique.</dd>

            <dt>Gudetama Cafe - Buena Park, CA</dt>
            <dd>The Gudetema cafe is based on the popular sanrio character, <i>Gudetama</i>. For a character-cafe, the food was decent. The decor and attention to detail was the best part!</dd>

    <h3>Final Remarks on Butler Cafe</h3>
    <p>Going to Butler in NYC was one of the most memorable meals! While the meal was from no michelin-star renowed place- the savory items, pastries, and drinks were solid. The cafe executed everything that they promised very well.</p>
    <p>However, I will note that my friend and I were starving when we discovered this place. It was so early in the morning and so we searched "open cafes near me" and walked in the direction <i>maps</i> suggested. It is possible that this meal was not as phenomenal as it truly was, but rather a reflection of our hunger that morning.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, I absolutely adored this place! So much so, I wished for a second that I could pack up my life and move to NYC solely for this place. I'm already making plans to come back!</p>
