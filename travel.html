        <h3>Boston & Cambridge</h3>
        <p>This summer, I flew by myself for the first time to visit my friends in Boston. While I was there, I stayed with one of my closest friends who was living there for the Summer to complete research.</p>

        <h3>My Favorite Things About Working With Princess</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>The CEE Team</dt>
            <dd>Each and every one of my colleagues is someone I can look up to. They're brilliant, hard working, and they set an exemplary standard for what it means to be an engineer and a leader. I learn something new from them everyday. I am incredibly thankful to be in a position to learn from such talented individuals.</dd>

            <dt>Collaboration Across Departments</dt>
            <dd>As a team who builds enterprise solutions, our stakeholders are primarly other departments within the company. I really enjoy getting to meet other people of different backgrounds- besides engineering- and learn about subjects like finance, operations, etc. There is always room for collaboration and learning about other industries.</dd>

            <dt>Company Events</dt>
            <dd>Princess Cruises makes an effort to connect with their employees. There have been a multitude of office events and gatherings! At the very first event I attended, I won a company raffle and got some headphones!</dd>

    <p>This website was created as part of our COMP 484 Project 1 assignment. Over the summer, I ended up with a camera roll full of photos and thought a website would be a nice way to document things I did!</p>
