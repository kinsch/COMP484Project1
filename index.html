        <h3>At a Glance</h3>
        <p>This summer was a mix of lattes, laptops, and last-minute flights. I spent <em>more time than I should have</em> café hopping with friends, joined the software engineering team of a cruise line at Princess Cruises, and decided to book a flight across the country a week before school started.</p>
        <p>It wasn't the most extravagant summer of all time, but my camera roll is full to the brim with more photos I thought my phone had storage for. I put this site together to serve as a little summer journal, and so I hope you enjoy flipping through (clicking through) some of my favorite places and happenings!</p>

        <h4>Café Hopping</h4>

        <p>One of my favorite parts of summer is having the free time to go places at a time when I'd usually be in class. These past few months, I've tried a variety of new places- including new foods and drinks! Getting to go out to the places that appear on my brilliantly-curated social media reccomendations is one of the best parts of summer break.</p>

        <h4>Princess Cruises</h4>

        <p>I had my first taste of corporate life this Summer. I joined a cruise company- Princess Cruises as a business analyst intern. I worked with cross-functional teams and our stakeholders to create software requirements. In addition to software specifications, I spent a lot of time learning about and working with our change management, QA, DevOps, and XOps teams.</p>
        <p>Post this experience, I've returned to the company as a Jr. Business Analyst and do much of the same stuff I learned as an intern! So when I wasn't out with friends or trying new places, I was probably in my cutely decorated cubicle.</p>

        <h4> Travelling With Friends</h4>

        <p>The week before school started, I headed to Boston to meet up with my friends! One of my closest friends moved there for the summer to complete her research and so I stayed with her for a bit! While I was there, I caught up with some other friends who'd moved there permanently. We visited so many states in such little time <em>(6 states in 5 days!)</em></p>

    <p>This website was created as part of our COMP 484 Project 1 assignment. Over the summer, I ended up with a camera roll full of photos and thought a website would be a nice way to document things I did!</p>
