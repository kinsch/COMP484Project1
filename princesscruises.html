        <h3>Getting Started with Princess Cruises</h3>
        <p><img src="images/princessLogo.png" alt="PrincessCruises" width="200" height="220" class="flowRight"/></p>
        <p>I joined Princess Cruises as a business analyst (BA) intern this Summer on their Commerce & Enterprise Engineering (CEE) team. As a BA, I worked with stakeholders to solidify the software requirements for our developers, documented our software products & processes, helped lead standups, and guide internal discussions. Outside of BA work, I was heavily involved in change management, helped out our QA teams, and frequently worked with the DevOps & xOps teams.</p>
        <p>As my first in-person internship, I was incredibly nervous to get started. However, I could not ask for a better team to be a part of or better fellow interns. Each of them made my experience with the company as great as it was and I am very grateful to have worked alongside them!</p>
        <p>Post-internship, I continue to work with the company as a Jr. BA and have picked up right where I left off! </p>

        <h3>Internship Project</h3>
        <h4>The Princess Pal</h4>
        <p>Working alongside two other interns, the three of us were tasked with coming up with a solution to target Gen-Z audiences. The Princess brand mainly targets an older demographic, and so we needed to lean in to the things we thought Gen-Z would enjoy. After conducting research, we found that much of Gen-Z enjoyed videogames and so we created an app that could be played in return for real-world, tangible rewards.</p>
        <p>Our team dubbed this app, the <em>Princess Pal</em>. The Princess Pal leaned into existing Princess mascots like Stanley the Bear and McKinley the Moose. We created a tamagotchi style app where users could nuture these characters, earn points, and exchange these points for rewards and discounts on the cruise.</p>

        <h3>My Favorite Things About Working With Princess</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>The CEE Team</dt>
            <dd>Each and every one of my colleagues is someone I can look up to. They're brilliant, hard working, and they set an exemplary standard for what it means to be an engineer and a leader. I learn something new from them everyday. I am incredibly thankful to be in a position to learn from such talented individuals.</dd>

            <dt>Collaboration Across Departments</dt>
            <dd>As a team who builds enterprise solutions, our stakeholders are primarly other departments within the company. I really enjoy getting to meet other people of different backgrounds- besides engineering- and learn about subjects like finance, operations, etc. There is always room for collaboration and learning about other industries.</dd>

            <dt>Company Events</dt>
            <dd>Princess Cruises makes an effort to connect with their employees. There have been a multitude of office events and gatherings! At the very first event I attended, I won a company raffle and got some headphones!</dd>

    <p>This website was created as part of our COMP 484 Project 1 assignment. Over the summer, I ended up with a camera roll full of photos and thought a website would be a nice way to document things I did!</p>
